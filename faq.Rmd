### Multiple outcomes / time-varying covariates

---

<div onclick="showHide('faq1')" style="cursor: pointer; font-weight:bold">How do I include time-varying covariates with the RI-CLPM?</div>

<div id="faq1" style="display:none">
Time-varying covariates (TVC; $Z$) can be included like “regular” X and Y outcomes in the RI-CLPM; hence, rather than a bivariate RI-CLPM you would specify a tri- or more-variate RI-CLPM. As such, you decompose the TVCs in within-components (e.g. $wz1$, $wz2$, etc.) and a between-component (the random intercept; e.g. $RI_{z}$) and model these components separately. However, if you want to control for many TVC's, this can quickly become an unwieldly model, so researchers should think carefully about which TVC's they want to control for. </div>

<div onclick="showHide('faq3')" style="cursor: pointer; font-weight:bold">Is it possible to run an RI-CLPM with three (or more) outcomes?</div>
 
<div id="faq3" style="display:none">
Yes, it is statistically possible to run a “trivariate” RI-CLPM and empirical researchers have done so, see for example [Burns, Crisp, and [Van Lissa et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000612). We don’t provide model code here for this mode, but extension to a trivariate RI-CLPM should be relatively straight forwards. That is, all variables should be decomponsed into between- (random intercepts) and within-components, and relevant lagged effects, as well as (residual) variances and covariances, should be included in the model.</div>

### Standardization

---

<div onclick="showHide('faq4')" style="cursor: pointer; font-weight:bold">How should I interpret the standardized cross-lagged and autoregressive parameters?</div>
 
<div id="faq4" style="display:none">
In the RI-CLPM, the standardized effects are reflective/representative of how much within-person variance in $y_{t}$ is *uniquely* explained (i.e., not also explained by other predictors) by the predictor $x_{t-1}$. Please note that this does not imply that one can make a one-on-one comparison with the percentage of explained variance. However, the standardized effects can be used to compare which effect is relatively stronger [(Schuurman, Ferrer, Boer-Sonnenschein, & Hamaker, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000062). </div>

<div onclick="showHide('faq5')" style="cursor: pointer; font-weight:bold">How do standardized cross-lagged and autoregressive parameters compare to explained variance?</div>
 
<div id="faq5" style="display:none">
The standardized lagged parameters are not equal to the (squared) semipartial correlation. Only under special circumstances, a standardized regression coefficient is equal to the pairwise correlation between the outcome and predictor, and the square of the standardized regression coefficient would then be the explained variance ($R^{2}$). This only applies in the case of (a) a simple regression, where there is only one predictor in the model, or (b) a multiple regression where the predictors are independent of each other. In the RI-CLPM, however, the multiple predictors are not independent of each other, and therefore the standardized regression coefficients are not equal to the pairwise correlation, (semi)partial correlation, or the unique explained variance. 

However, the standardized coefficient is closely related to the semipartial correlation, as demonstrated in footnote 3 of [Schuurman, Ferrer, Boer-Sonnenschein, and Hamaker (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000062). The standardized coefficient is expressed in terms of pairwise correlations in the first equation there, and the semipartial correlation expressed in terms of pairwise correlations in the second equation. They are very similar, but there is a subtle difference in the denominator.
 
So, the semipartial correlation and standardized coefficient are not equal, but we can see that if the semipartical correlation for one predictor is larger than for another predictor, this will also be the case for the standardized coefficients of these predictors. The square of the semi-partial correlation is the *unique* explained variance, so we also know that the predictor with the largest standardized coefficient, will also have the largest *unique* explained variance.

### Non-continuous outcomes

---

<div onclick="showHide('faq2')" style="cursor: pointer; font-weight:bold">Can I run the RI-CLPM with binary/categorical/count outcomes? </div>
 
<div id="faq2" style="display:none">
The RI-CLPM is currently only well-studied/well-developed for the continuous case. Research into RI-CLPMs with only categorical data, or with non-commensurate outcomes (i.e., outcomes measured in different scales, continuous and binary) is still ongoing. See, for example, [the Mplus discussion board](http://www.statmodel.com/discussion/messages/23/23001.html?1530924636). </div>

### Time & time-lags

---

<div onclick="showHide('faq6')" style="cursor: pointer; font-weight:bold">How to deal with unequal intervals between repeated measures?</div>

<div id="faq6" style="display:none">
The lagged regression coefficients depend on the time lag between repeated measures (in a non-linear way). If the lags between subsequent occasions vary, qualitatively different autoregressive and cross-lagged effects between each pair of adjacent measurements are estimated. The advice is to **not** constrain these parameters over time in this case, as this would lead to an uninterpretable blend of different lagged relationships. Neither should the residual variances and covariances (of the within-components) be constrained to be invariant over time, as these also depend on the interval between measurements. </div>

### Power

---
<div onclick="showHide('faq8')" style="cursor: pointer; font-weight:bold">How do I perform a power analysis for the RI-CLPM?</div>

<div id="faq8" style="display:none">We are currently developing an R-package for performing power analyses for the RI-CLPM. It is expected to be available for download early June 2021. You can also perform a power analysis using the [MONTECARLO functionality of Mplus](https://www.statmodel.com/download/usersguide/Chapter12.pdf).</div>
