| **November 23rd, 2021** | We have added [residual model syntax specifications for Mplus](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/mplus.html#Residual_syntax), in which we use the new "hat-notation" of Mplus version 8.7, as well as `PON` and `PWITH` statements to allow for simpler input files. Furthermore, the FAQ was updated with the latest information on [the RI-CLPM for categorical variables](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/faq.html#Non-continuous_outcomes), and a new question and answer concerning [development over time](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/faq.html#Growth_and_development) in the RI-CLPM was added.|
| **July 7th, 2021** | We have updated the [FAQ](https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/faq.html#Response_to_Orth_et_al_(2021)) with an informal response to some of the conclusions drawn by Orth et al. (2021) regarding the use and appropriateness of the CLPM and RI-CLPM.
