    "text": "This website is a supplement to “Three Extensions of the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model” by Mulder and Hamaker (2020). It contains Mplus syntax and lavaan code for specifying the basic RI-CLPM and the following three extensions:\n\nincluding a time-invariant predictor and outcome,\ndoing multiple group analysis, and\nusing multiple indictors for variables.\n\nUse the top menu to navigate to the Mplus syntax, lavaan code, News, or Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). The lavaan (R) tab contains additional code for performing the \\(\\bar{\\chi}^{2}\\)-test (chi-bar-square test) in R. This test is used for comparing nested models where the more parsimonious model is based on constraining parameters on the bound of the parameter space (e.g., constraining a variance to 0). The News tab documents important updates and additions to the Mplus syntax, lavaan model syntax, or the FAQ on this website.\n\nData\nYou can find simulated example data sets (1189 units, 5 repeated-measures) on GitHub to get hands-on experience with this modeling approach. The example data are motivated by (Narmandakh2020?) who obtained five waves of data from 1189 adolescents on their sleep problems and anxiety over 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMulder, Jeroen D., and Ellen L.

    "text": "Setup\nFor Mplus (Muthén and Muthén 2017) to work properly, make sure that you save the input file with the model specification (example.inp) in the same folder as the data (example.dat). You can download the simulated example datasets here. Mplus includes defaults, like that:\n\nobserved and latent exogenous variables are correlated, and\nresiduals of observed and latent outcome variables (which do not predict anything) in a path model are correlated.\n\nThese defaults are included to make the specification of many standard SEM models easier, but they are not always useful in the current modeling context. Therefore, we use the command ANALYSIS: MODEL = NOCOV; to overrule these defaults for the covariances and set all of them to zero.\nFrom Mplus version 8.7 onward, the Residual Structural Equation Modeling (RSEM) capabilities have been expanded (Asparouhov2021?). This allows for considerably simpler model syntax for the RI-CLPM using the ^ command. You can find Mplus syntax using this alternative hats-notation for the basic RI-CLPM (both with and without constraints over time) in the Residual syntax section."

    "text": "The RI-CLPM\nTo specify the RI-CLPM we need four parts.\n\nA between part, consisting of the random intercepts. It is specified using the BY command, RIx BY x1@1 x2@1 ...;, where @1 fixes the factor loading to one.\nA within part, consisting of within-unit fluctuations. It is also specified using the BY command, wx1 BY x1; wx2 BY x2; .... We do not have to constrain the factor loading to 1, as this is already the default in Mplus for the factor loading of the first indicator of a latent variable. However, we do need to constrain the measurement error variances to zero, as Mplus will include them by default when we use the BY statement. We do this by including x1@0 x2@0 x3@0 x4@0 x5@0; where @0 fixes the measurement error variances to zero, which is the same as saying there is no measurement error.\nThe lagged regressions between the within-unit components, using wx2 ON wx1 wy1; wx3 ON wx2 wy2; ....\nRelevant covariances in both the between and within part. In the within part the components at wave 1, and their residuals at waves 2 and further are correlated within each wave, using wx1 WITH wy1; wx2 WITH wy2;....

Compared to the basic model, there are multiple changes to the syntax. First, we freely estimate the factor loadings that link the observed variables to the within-components, rather than fixing them to 1:\n! Create within-components with freely estimated factor loadings\nwx1 BY x1*; \nwx2 BY x2*;\nwx3 BY x3*; \nwx4 BY x4*; \nwx5 BY x5*;\n                \nwy1 BY y1*; \nwy2 BY y2*;\nwy3 BY y3*; \nwy4 BY y4*; \nwy5 BY y5*;\nSecond, we set the variances of within-components at first wave to 1, and label the covariance (now also the correlation) between them:\n! Set variances of within-components at first wave to 1\nwx1@1 wy1@1;\n\n! Estimate correlation between within-components at first wave\nwx1 WITH wy1 (cor1);\nThird, we give the residual variance and covariances between the within-component each a unique label:\nwx2 WITH wy2 (rcov2); wx2 (rvx2); wy2 (rvy2);\nwx3 WITH wy3 (rcov3); wx3 (rvx3); wy3 (rvy3);\nwx4 WITH wy4 (rcov4); wx4 (rvx4); wy4 (rvy4); \nwx5 WITH wy5 (rcov5); wx5 (rvx5); wy5 (rvy5);\nFinally, we compute the correlations between the within-components themselves at each wave, and then constrain the residual variances to ensure that the total variance of each within-component equals 1. This is done in the MODEL CONSTRAINT command:\nMODEL CONSTRAINT:\n  ! Compute correlations of within-components at each wave\n  NEW(cor2);\n  NEW(cor3);\n  NEW(cor4);\n  \n  cor2 = a*c + b*d + a*d*cor1 + b*c*cor1 + rcov2;\n  cor3 = a*c + b*d + a*d*cor2 + b*c*cor2 + rcov3;\n  cor4 = a*c + b*d + a*d*cor3 + b*c*cor3 + rcov4;\n \n  ! Contrain residual variances of within-components such that variance of each \n  ! within-component equals 1\n  rvx2 = 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor1);\n  rvy2 = 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor1);\n  rvx3 = 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor2);\n  rvy3 = 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor2);\n  rvx4 = 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor3);\n  rvy4 = 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor3);\n  rvx5 = 1 - (a*a + b*b + 2*a*b*cor4);\n  rvy5 = 1 - (c*c + d*d + 2*c*d*cor4);"

    "text": "Ext. 2: multiple group\nUse the tabs below to navigate to the model specification of the basic multiple-group model, or the model with constrained lagged parameters (and intercepts across groups).\nTo specify a multiple group RI-CLPM, we need to overrule some of the defaults that Mplus will impose and that are associated with multiple group factor analysis. The reason for this is that when we use the BY statement in combination with multiple groups, Mplus will automatically impose the defaults that are associated with strong factorial invariance (Meredith1993?). These defaults are:\n\nequal factor loadings across the groups,\nequal intercepts for the observed variables across the groups, and\nfree latent means in the second (and subsequent) group(s).\n\nIn the context of a multiple-group RI-CLPM, the first constraint is not an issue as all the factor loadings are supposed to be constrained to one in both groups. However, the second constraint on the intercepts and the freeing of the latent means in the second group are not sensible here. There will be fewer observed variables than latent variables defined with a BY statement (i.e., a within-unit part for each observed variable, plus a random intercept for each variable); as a result, we would try to estimate more means than that there were observed. Such a model is unidentified. We should therefore overrule the defaults associated with the mean structure. We do this by adding for the second group [x1 x2 ...]; which frees the intercepts for the observed variables in the second group. Additionally, we include [wx1@0 wx2@0 ... ]; [RIx@0]; for the second group, which ensures all latent means are fixed to zero.\n\nThe basic model\nBelow you can find the code for a multiple group RI-CLPM with 5 waves.\nTITLE:      Multiple group RI-CLPM, 5 waves. \n            Overruling the Mplus multiple group factor analysis defaults.\n            \nDATA:       FILE = RICLPM-MG.dat;\n                \nVARIABLE:   NAMES = x1-x5 y1-y5 GROUP;\n            GROUPING = GROUP (1=G1 2=G2);\n    \nANALYSIS:   MODEL = NOCOV; !

Moreover, this notation fixes the measurement error variance of the observed variable to 0, such that, in an RI-CLPM context, x1^ and y3^ can be interpreted as deviations from a person-specific mean. This notation is available from Mplus version 8.7 onward.\nPON and PWITH: These statements define pairwise regression and correlational relationships, respectively.

    "text": "For Mplus (Muthén and Muthén 2017) to work properly, make sure that you save the input file with the model specification (example.inp) in the same folder as the data (example.dat). You can download the simulated example datasets here. Mplus includes defaults, like that:\nThese defaults are included to make the specification of many standard SEM models easier, but they are not always useful in the current modeling context. Therefore, we use the command ANALYSIS: MODEL = NOCOV; to overrule these defaults for the covariances and set all of them to zero.\nFrom Mplus version 8.7 onward, the Residual Structural Equation Modeling (RSEM) capabilities have been expanded (Asparouhov and Muthén 2021). This allows for considerably simpler model syntax for the RI-CLPM using the ^ command. You can find Mplus syntax using this alternative hats-notation for the basic RI-CLPM (both with and without constraints over time) in the Residual syntax section."
